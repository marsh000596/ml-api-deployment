# ML API Deployment with FastAPI & Docker 🚀

A production-ready pipeline to serve machine learning models using FastAPI, Docker, and GitHub Actions.
##

# Features

- FastAPI-based REST API
- Dockerized for portability
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Ready for AWS EC2 or Render deployment

##

## Usage

```bash
docker build -t ml-api .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 ml-api
```

# WHAT HAS BEEN BUILT

🏗️ Project Name:
- ML Prediction API Deployment with Web Portal

- 📦 Project Stack:
- Python
- FastAPI (for web server and API)
- Jinja2 Templates (for web UI rendering) # Add
- Scikit-learn (for ML model)
- Docker (optional for deployment)

##
# 🧠 PROJECT PURPOSE & INTENT
- Created a full-stack pipeline for taking user input → passing it to an ML model → showing the prediction both via a browser (web form) and as an API response.

- This is a real-world ML application pattern used in:
- ML model serving
- Data product prototyping
- Internal prediction tools
- AI-backed forms and dashboards
##

# 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

🧩 1. Inputs
The app takes two numeric inputs:
feature1 (float)
feature2 (float)
Users enter them via a web form or through a JSON API POST request.

#🤖 2. Model
- Trained and saved a binary classification model (likely using scikit-learn), which:
- Takes [feature1, feature2] or a preprocessed version
- Returns a prediction: 0 or 1

The prediction could mean:

0 = Negative Class (e.g., not spam, not eligible, etc.)

1 = Positive Class (e.g., spam, eligible, fraud, etc.)
##


# 🌐 3. Web Portal (Frontend)
Built using Jinja2 + HTML

User submits input via form (POST /predict_web)

Output: "Prediction: 0" or "Prediction: 1"

##

# 4. API Endpoint (Optional JSON version)

```http
# POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "feature1": 5.6,
  "feature2": 3.1
}
```


Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": 1
}
```

# 🧪 WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
- ✅ Built an end-to-end pipeline:
  
Model → Web UI → API → Prediction Display

- ✅ Validated model logic and ensured working input/output
- ✅ Learned how to connect ML models with production-ready FastAPI endpoint
- ✅ Enabled predictions via browser and APIs
- ✅ Modular code using:

schemas.py for input/output structures

model.py for loading and predicting

utils.py for preprocessing logic

# 🔍 ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. 🧪 Model Enhancements

- Train on real-world data

-  Use more features

-  Add model evaluation (accuracy, ROC, etc.)

-  Include confidence scores or probability

2. 🌐 Web UI Improvements
-  Make the form cleaner with Bootstrap or Tailwind

-  Display prediction messages in green/red

-  Add tooltips or help text

3. ⚙️ Deployment Enhancements
-  Dockerize for deployment on:

-  AWS EC2, Render, Heroku

-  Kubernetes if scaling is needed

-  Add logging, health checks, and rate limiting

4. 🧪 Input Validation
-  Validate data ranges

 - Handle bad inputs gracefully (e.g., empty or wrong format)

5. 🔐 Security & Access Control
- Add basic auth / token-based API key

- Prevent abuse

# 📚 What This Project Is
A complete ML inference application, which loads a trained model, accepts inputs from a web form or API, makes a prediction, and returns it to the user in real-time.
## 📝 Summary

> This project serves as a **minimal yet complete blueprint** for deploying a machine learning model as a web application using FastAPI. You can easily scale or replace the model and host the app for real users or stakeholders.
